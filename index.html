<h1>Sheikh Abubakar Gumi</h1> 
<section id="main">
   <div id="title">
<p>Abubakar Mahmud Gumi (5 November 1922 – 11 September 1992)[1][2] was an outspoken Islamic scholar and Grand Khadi of the Northern Region of Nigeria (1962–1967), a position which made him a central authority in the interpretation of the Sharia legal system in the region.[3] He was a close associate of Ahmadu Bello, the premier of the Northern region in the 1950s and 1960s and became the Grand Khadi in 1967, the position was abolished.</p>

<p>Gumi emerged as a vocal leader during the colonial era, where he felt the practice of indirect rule had weakened the religious power of Emirs and encouraged westernization. Beginning in the 1960s, public conflicts emerged between him and leaders of the Sufi brotherhood, some of whom he later debated on television programs in the 1970s and 1980s. By that time, he had managed to keep his ideas in the spotlight by holding Friday talking sessions inside the Kaduna Central Mosque (Sultan Bello Mosque). He used the sessions to revive his criticism of established authorities based on his views of a back to the source approach or the need to embrace a puritanical practice of Islam. He also criticized harshly the involvement of mysticism and the resulting syncreticized practice of the Sufis.

<p>He has a large number of children, however his most popular child happens to be Dr Ahmad Abubakar Gumi who succeeded his father as the scholar of the central mosque Kaduna (Sultan Bello), Dr Ahmad Gumi is a certified medical doctor from Ahmadu Bello University Zaria and was a former military officer, he left the military and travel to study fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) at the umm Al-Qura University in Mecca, Saudi Arabia where he obtained his PhD.</p>

<p>Abubakar Gumi has proven not to have anything to do with the present Nigerian sunni movement of Boko haram because of his strong support for democracy, civil law and western education since his early years as a teacher, he's often quoted to have said, "during election, voting is more necessary than to pray".</p>

<p>Gumi is a follower of the Maliki school of thought, this was derived through his writings including his Qur'anic tafsir (Raddul azhaan ila ma'anil kur'an) and other books like (hullu nizam ala nuzuul isa).[4]</p>

    <h2>Conflicts</h2>
    <p>Abubakar Gummi had reservations about the administrative and religious guidance of the emirate officials in Northern Nigeria. His first dogmatic conflict with authorities was in Maru. The conflict dealt with the practice of Tayammum. The chief Imam of the Mosque in Maru practiced the act of washing with sand (Tayammum) before prayers while Gumi argued that Tayammum was only applicable when water was not available, and water was widely available in Maru. Gumi went further in his challenge of the practice, by asking students not to show up for prayers until the Imam reneged on practicing Tayammum. However, Gumi who had earlier written a scathing attack on the Sultan of Sokoto, now found the Sultan interested in his grievance with the Chief Imam of Maru. A commission of Inquiry was raised on the issue with the support of the Sultan. However, Gumi's knowledge of Islamic dogma was superior and so was his argumentative skills, the commission ruled in favor of Gumi.[7] Having gained a small victory over the Sultan, Gumi capitalized on the attention he got by writing a critical article on the issue of Muslims, especially the Sultan, accepting British titles. By then, he had begun to gradually challenge established beliefs and attitude to actions among the Muslim Ummah.[8]</p>

    <p>Another target of Gumi was the Jibril Martin led Ahmadiyya movement. The movement was an easy target for Gumi, as some of the movement founder's views were at odds with fundamental Islamic dogma, as the founder had labeled himself prophetic. Gumi's fears about the movement were later fomented by the organizational skills of the Nigerian founder, the movement gradually became involved in the Western Nigerian pilgrimage board and had established schools for pupils in the South and was moving up north in his dissemination of the principles of the Ahmadis. Gumi took on the challenge easily and the movement's northward agenda was curtailed.</p>

<h2>Rise of Izala and Islamic Fundamentalism</h2>
<p>By the late 1960s, after the death of Bello, Gumi's major Nigerian political support and moderating influence was gone. He felt the new administration had the political power to curtail his views, and in the process, he resulted to consult his friends in Saudi Arabia for moral, dogmatic and financial support to promote a Wahabbist interpretation of Islam centering on the rejection of mysticism, return to puritanical Islamic teaching and rejection of the then dominant Sufi brotherhoods. He also wanted to find mass support in his battle with the brotherhood and what he felt was their hold on the political process. Gumi, became more interested in ensuring political support for his ideas, based on his perception that a political Muslim has the power to change the course of lives of a larger number of people than publishing scholarly works or engaging in private debates and gradually became more interested in political means to achieve an Islamic reformist end. In the process, he became a supporter of women's rights to vote. By the early 1970s, to contest what he felt was the hijacking of major Islamic political organizations by the Fityan al-Islam, an organization founded in Kano by Mudi Salga, a leader of the Salgawa network and who was opposed to some of the policies of the late Ahmadu Bello and his Jamaat nasr al-Islam (the Association for the support of Islam). He decided to start a movement and relied on his old students to spread his views on Islamic dogma,[10] prodding many to take jobs at the JNI and enter into legislative duties. He used his students as a foundation for the new movement to challenge the Sufi brotherhoods and ensure a return of Islam to a fundamental way. The rise of this movement Izalatul Bidi'a Wa Ikamatul Sunnah or Movement for the Rivival of the Sunnah, popularly called Izala, heralded the radicalization of Northern Nigeria.</p>

<p>Many within the political cycles and Sufi Brotherhoods of Northern Nigeria held that Gumi was the principle that drove a wedge between Muslims and non Muslims in Northern Nigeria, his interpretations of the Hadith and Qur'an were based on his own personal views and not the Sunnah, and that he was monopolizing the mass media for his personal views. He was also criticized for his rebellious views on traditional authorities.[11]</p>

<p>Gumi believed that Nigerian Muslims should never accept a non-Muslim ruler but also advocated peaceful coexistence with non-Muslims groups.[2]</p>

    <h2>Awards and Honours</h2>
    <p>He received the Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic in 1987, he received the King Faisal International Prize from Saudi Arabia for his translation of the Quran into Hausa language.[2]</p>

<p>Abubakar gumi who was referred to as the father of izala as he usually mentioned during his Islamic teaching process, succeeded in overwhelming the establishment of the 1970s organisation by name izalatul bidi'ah wa iqamatussunah co-founded by one of his prominent student whom gumi tutor in his previous job as a school teacher at school of Arabic studies (sas) in kano, though he also maintain his membership in jama'atu nasrul Islam (JNI) which favour him to proceed in his Islamic teachings at kaduna central mosque handed by the above-mentioned oorganisation JNI.</p>
